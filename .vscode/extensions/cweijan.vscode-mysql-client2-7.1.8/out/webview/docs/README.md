### About this project

I am a developer who pays attention to efficiency, I can't stand the clumsiness of navicat and datagrip, so from 2019.3 I created this project to improve my development efficiency.

At the beginning, this extension only supports mysql, so the name is still kept as mysql, and it released under the new name, and these two extensions will be updated synchronously.

- [MySQL - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cweijan.vscode-mysql-client2)
- [Database Client - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cweijan.vscode-database-client2)

After 2022.3, this project will require payment, based on two considerations:

1. I often receive bad reviews, because some features don't satisfy these users, they don't care how much effort I put into it, and give extremely bad reviews, which makes me sad and angry.
2. I need money.

I'm just stating why, not to stop bad reviews, my focus now shifts from reviews to software quality.
